// Naming convention Variables names, Functions names, ...

- Camel case 
	studentNumbers
- can contain letters, digits, underscores
- can start with letter or underscore only
- case Sensitive
- identifiers can be used as variables names : int, uint
	var int = "hello"
- keywords cannot be used as variables names 25 keyword	
	package, import, select
	func, return
	var, const
	struct, map, interface, type
	if, else
	for, break, continue, range
	switch, case, default
	go, goto
	defer, chan, fallthrough
	
- we can use _ as variable name -> blank identifiers
  as we know Go Compilier -> give us error if we identified a variable and didn't use
  we can use blank Identifier in case we must declare a variable and discard it latter without using it

- we can define Exported Identifier -> we will see it later in the course when we have more than one package
  in our project 
  this Identifier 
  	-> Start with Captital letter
	-> must be declared on Package level
